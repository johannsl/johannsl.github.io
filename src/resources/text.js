  "Expressing myself through color and visual elements gives me a more meaningful life. I don't always know what " +
    "I'm searching for, but the process toward something 'optimal' seems like a guiding principle to get to know myself " +
    "better. It can be difficult to understand how the creative process unfolds and why. Often, I experiment with " +
    "different expressions and discard them if an immediate connection or communication doesn't occur.",
  "I find inspiration in many places, but I am always fascinated by music, literature, and films with unpredictable " +
    "narratives. I work extensively to bring out unique and condensed color combinations, and this work can be a slow " +
    "adjustment process. Older colorists like Gauguin and Nesterov always provide me with good impulses, but I also " +
    "find some contemporary art stimulating. For me, the goal is to create a painting that can evoke wonder, and the " +
    "expression can often be 'slow-paced' and mysterious.",
  "My approach to the work depends on the format I am working with. The pattern works are relatively large, and " +
    "here I first set up an underlying grid/repeat. Sometimes I paint over the entire surface so that only small " +
    "traces remain, and other times the focus is on the composed pattern - but deviations are always exciting! The " +
    "material here is canvas, which I eventually stretch onto a frame.",
  "The multicolored linocuts are carefully planned before starting. The challenge here is to make form and colors " +
    "work together. The expression usually consists of 3 or 4 plates. These works are narratives with a clear " +
    "figurative visual language.",
  "In the smaller paintings on paper, the process is different - here I work entirely intuitively throughout the " +
    "process, following thoughts and ideas that come up at the moment.",
  "Many find it confusing to work with different expressions, but for me, it's a good thing because I always feel " +
    "renewed and stimulated when I return to a specific form of expression after a period of absence.",

export const pressBoaTitle = "BOA 2009 Painted Patterns";
export const pressBoaText = [
  "Astrid Slettevold's paintings are based on a predetermined pattern that recurs in all the images she presents at " +
    "Gallery BOA. At the same time, they appear very different through various color combinations. The color choices " +
    "evoke associations that can lead thoughts towards different cultures or more abstract and personal emotions. " +
    "Some of the paintings may evoke thoughts of the safe and familiar. They can remind us of a pillow our grandmother " +
    "had on the sofa or the bedspread at the cabin, and the references will be personal and tied to our individual " +
    "stories. Other paintings are done in colors that evoke distant places and foreign cultures. They may remind us " +
    "of a trip we once took, awaken the old dream of seeing the pyramids, or traveling to the ends of the earth. " +
    "The paintings have titles like 'My Norwegian Ancestors' and 'Persian Passion' emphasizing how the colors can " +
    "evoke both the domestic and the oriental, even though the pattern is identical.",
  "The color choices stem from Astrid Slettevold's interest in vegetation and associations with the scents and " +
    "flavors of different landscapes. The slightly heavy Norwegian colors are a product of our country's resources " +
    "(plant-based dyes and iron oxides from the earth, etc.), while other places may have a different climate with " +
    "different vegetation resulting in entirely different colors. The idea that the colors derived from natural " +
    "resources form mental concepts of mood and temperament in various cultures is an intriguing perspective. Perhaps " +
    "we are also dealing with a self-fulfilling prophecy, where the colors we use in everyday life fill us with energy " +
    "in different ways and influence our collective identity.",
  "'Bemalte m√∏nstre' (Painted Patterns) is a series of paintings where the artist has wanted to shift her focus away " +
    "from form in order to concentrate more on the colors. After establishing a relatively rigid system as her " +
    "foundation, the process is disrupted through experimentation with colors and shades. Paradoxically, the form " +
    "becomes central due to repetition. Even though the organization of the surfaces is done at the beginning of the " +
    "work, it is the choice of colors that conveys the idea of the work's content and characteristics. However, the " +
    "repetitive pattern creates a focus on form that is impossible to avoid. Through the various associations that the " +
    "colors evoke, the form emerges as universal, and one can see both the similarities and differences that " +
    "characterize our visual world with its history and geographically determined possibilities.",
  "Questions and inquiries can be directed to the gallery consultant, Hans E. Thorsen.",
